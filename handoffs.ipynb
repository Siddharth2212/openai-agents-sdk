      "outline='Loops in JavaScript' tutorial=\"# Loops in JavaScript\\n\\n## 1. Introduction to Loops\\n\\nLoops let you run the same block of code multiple times. They are useful when you need to repeat a task, such as processing each item in a list, or counting numbers.\\n\\nFor example, if you want to print numbers from 1 to 5, using a loop is much more efficient than writing five separate `console.log` statements.\\n\\n## 2. The `for` Loop\\n\\nThe `for` loop is one of the most commonly used loop types in JavaScript. Its syntax is:\\n\\n```javascript\\nfor (initialization; condition; increment) {\\n  // code to run on each loop iteration\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### Example: Counting from 1 to 5\\n```javascript\\nfor (let i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {\\n  console.log(i);\\n}\\n// Output: 1 2 3 4 5\\n```\\n\\n### Using `for` with Arrays\\n```javascript\\nconst fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry'];\\nfor (let i = 0; i < fruits.length; i++) {\\n  console.log(fruits[i]);\\n}\\n// Output: apple banana cherry\\n```\\n\\n## 3. The `while` Loop\\n\\nA `while` loop repeats as long as a condition remains true.\\n\\n```javascript\\nwhile (condition) {\\n  // code block\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### Example: Simple Guessing Game\\n```javascript\\nlet correct = false;\\nlet count = 0;\\nwhile (!correct && count < 3) {\\n  // In practice, you'd use user input from prompt(), here we just simulate\\n  let guess = Math.floor(Math.random() * 10); // random number between 0 and 9\\n  console.log('Guess:', guess);\\n  correct = guess === 5;\\n  count++;\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### When to Use `while` vs `for`\\n- Use `for` when you know how many times you want to loop.\\n- Use `while` when the number of iterations isn't known up front.\\n\\n## 4. The `do...while` Loop\\n\\nThe `do...while` loop guarantees the code block runs at least once.\\n\\n```javascript\\ndo {\\n  // code block\\n} while (condition);\\n```\\n\\n### Example: Validating User Input\\n```javascript\\nlet input;\\ndo {\\n  input = Math.floor(Math.random() * 5); // Simulating user input\\n  console.log('Input was:', input);\\n} while (input !== 3); // repeat until input is 3\\n```\\n\\n## 5. Loop Control Statements\\n\\n### `break`\\n`break` exits the loop immediately.\\n```javascript\\nfor (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {\\n  if (i === 4) break;\\n  console.log(i);\\n}\\n// Output: 0 1 2 3\\n```\\n\\n### `continue`\\n`continue` skips to the next iteration.\\n```javascript\\nfor (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {\\n  if (i % 2 === 0) continue; // skip even numbers\\n  console.log(i);\\n}\\n// Output: 1 3\\n```\\n\\n### Example: Filtering Even Numbers\\n```javascript\\nconst numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6];\\nfor (let i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) {\\n  if (numbers[i] % 2 !== 0) continue; // only process even numbers\\n  console.log(numbers[i]);\\n}\\n// Output: 2 4 6\\n```\\n\\n## 6. Iterating over Arrays\\n\\n### Using `for...of` (ES6)\\n```javascript\\nconst colors = ['red', 'green', 'blue'];\\nfor (const color of colors) {\\n  console.log(color);\\n}\\n// Output: red green blue\\n```\\n\\n### Using `forEach()`\\n```javascript\\ncolors.forEach(function(color) {\\n  console.log(color);\\n});\\n// Output: red green blue\\n```\\n\\n## 7. Iterating over Objects\\n\\n### Using `for...in`\\n```javascript\\nconst person = { name: 'Alice', age: 25, city: 'Paris' };\\nfor (const key in person) {\\n  console.log(key, person[key]);\\n}\\n// Output: name Alice  age 25  city Paris\\n```\\n\\n### Caveats and Best Practices\\n- `for...in` is for object properties, not array elements (may include unexpected inherited properties).\\n- For arrays, prefer `for`, `for...of`, or `forEach`.\\n\\n## 8. Common Pitfalls\\n\\n### Infinite Loops\\nA missing stop condition causes infinite looping:\\n```javascript\\n// Be careful: this will run forever!\\n// for (let i = 0; i < 10; ) {\\n//   console.log(i); // i is never updated!\\n// }\\n```\\n\\n### Modifying the Loop Variable\\nChanging the loop variable inside the loop can cause bugs:\\n```javascript\\nfor (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {\\n  if (i === 2) i = 4;\\n  console.log(i);\\n}\\n// Output: 0 1 2 4\\n// Loop ends after i = 4 (which then becomes 5, ending the loop)\\n```\\n\\n## 9. Practical Examples\\n\\n### Summing Numbers\\n```javascript\\nlet sum = 0;\\nfor (let i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {\\n  sum += i;\\n}\\nconsole.log('Sum is', sum); // Output: Sum is 55\\n```\\n\\n### Searching an Array\\n```javascript\\nconst animals = ['cat', 'dog', 'elephant'];\\nlet found = false;\\nfor (const animal of animals) {\\n  if (animal === 'dog') {\\n    found = true;\\n    break;\\n  }\\n}\\nconsole.log('Found dog?', found); // Output: Found dog? true\\n```\\n\\n### Building a New Array Based on Condition\\n```javascript\\nconst nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6];\\nconst evens = [];\\nfor (const num of nums) {\\n  if (num % 2 === 0) {\\n    evens.push(num);\\n  }\\n}\\nconsole.log(evens); // Output: [2, 4, 6]\\n```\\n\\n## 10. Conclusion\\n\\nJavaScript supports several types of loops: `for`, `while`, `do...while`, `for...of`, and `for...in`. Choose a loop based on the task and data structure:\\n- Use `for` or `for...of` for arrays.\\n- Use `for...in` for objects.\\n- Use `while` or `do...while` when the number of iterations isn't predetermined.\\n\\nLoops are powerful; use them wisely to efficiently handle repetitive tasks!\"\n"

This invasion prompted Britain and France to declare war on Germany two days later, on September 3, 1939.\\n\\n### Context Leading to the War:\\n\\n1. **Treaty of Versailles (1919):** After World War I, the Treaty of Versailles placed heavy reparations and territorial losses on Germany. This caused economic hardship and resentment among Germans.\\n\\n2. **Rise of Fascism:** During the 1920s and 1930s, fascist regimes emerged in several countries. Hitler\\'s rise to power in Germany in 1933 was a significant turning point, as he sought to overturn the post-World War I order and expand German territory.\\n\\n3. **Expansion and Appeasement:**\\n   - **Reoccupation of the Rhineland (1936):** Germany reoccupied this demilitarized zone, violating the Treaty of Versailles.\\n   - **Annexation of Austria (1938):** Known as the Anschluss, Austria was annexed into Germany.\\n   - **Munich Agreement (1938):** Britain and France allowed Germany to annex the Sudetenland, part of Czechoslovakia, in hopes of preventing further aggression.\\n\\n4. **Non-Aggression Pact (1939):** Germany and the Soviet Union signed the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, pledging not to attack each other. Secretly, they agreed to divide Eastern Europe between them.\\n\\n### Immediate Cause:\\n\\n- **Invasion of Poland:** Germany\\'s attack on Poland was swift, using a strategy known as \"Blitzkrieg\" or lightning war, characterized by fast-moving, coordinated strikes using aircraft, tanks, and troops. The Soviet Union invaded Poland from the east on September 17, 1939, effectively dividing the country.\\n\\nThese actions set off a series of events that escalated into a global conflict involving many nations, eventually drawing in countries such as the United States and the Soviet Union, and lasting until 1945.'"
